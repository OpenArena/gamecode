# OpenArena eXpanded Changelog resume

## Important changes since OA 0.8.8

### Laconic version

**Note:** An ampersand ("&") preceding a value means that the cvar is a bitflag, and you must add said value to the total before using its effect (i.e. if dmflags is 1096 and you want to add the new underwater speed -`dmflags &4096`-, then dmflags should be 5192 (1096+4096).

* New gamemode: Possession:
  * Players must hold a flag (the white flag from 1FCTF) for X seconds in order to win. Or be the player with the highest amount of carrying time.
  * Uses `fraglimit` (holding time in seconds, i.e. `fraglimit 120` for 2 minutes, the default time) and `timelimit`.
  * It can be voted after matches as `/13`. (Credit: @The-Gig)
* New cvars:
  * `cg_bob`: Controls how bobbing behaves in-game. It accepts the following values: (Credits: @ldrone (options 0/1) and @leilei (options 2-6))
    * `cg_bob 0`: Disables it.
    * `cg_bob 1`: Pitch/Roll/Up Bob.
    * `cg_bob 2`: Pitch/Up-only Bob.
    * `cg_bob 3`: Roll/Up-only Bob.
    * `cg_bob 4`: Up-only Bob.
    * `cg_bob 6`: "Fake '99" a.k.a. "Sweeny Bob". (We cannot write the actual name because [writing around trademarks](https://tvtropes.org/Main/WritingAroundTrademarks))
  * `cg_kickScale`: Controls how much the screen shakes when hit. (Credit: @ldrone)
  * `cg_muzzleFlashStyle`: Controls how the muzzle flash is rendered. (Credit: @leilei)
  * `cg_obituaryOutput`: Controls how and where the death messages are rendered. (Credit: @ldrone)
  * `g_classicMode`. It replaces `g_runes` by extending it. In addition to removing the Runes, it also replaces the Nailgun with the Shotgun, the Chaingun with the Machinegun ammo, the Prox Launcher with the Grenade Launcher, the Kamikaze holdable with the Personal Teleporter and the Invulnerability holdable with the Medkit. In Round-based gamemodes, it prevents the Nailgun, Chaingun and Prox Launcher from being added to the player's starting inventory.
  * `g_ddCaptureTime` and `g_ddRespawnDelay` for Double Domination. Both control the amount of holding time required to score, and the time between the scoring and start of a new round.
  * `g_grapple`. It replaces `elimination_grapple` by extending it so it works with all gamemodes.
  * `g_harvesterFromBodies` for Harvester. If enabled, skulls spawn from bodies rather than a central skull generator. Allows Harvester matches to take place in maps without a skull generator. However, the placement of a skull generator is still recommended for those cases where the players commit suicide or are killed via level hazard.
  * `g_weaponArena` and `g_weaponArenaWeapon`. The former replaces `g_rockets` by extending it so it can be used with any weapon, not just the Rocket Launcher. The latter controls which weapon is spawned by `g_weaponArena`.
  * `missionpackChecks`. Enables/disables missionpack checkers in both Classic UI and UI3. It's enabled by default for the latter, and disabled for the former.
* New commands:
  * `+acc`. Reveals your weapon accuracy after matches.
  * `dropRune`. Frees the rune for another teammate to use it.
  * `ui_writemappools`. Dumps the gamelists so they can be used by `g_autonextmap`, provided the .arena files (and arenas.txt) are loaded first.
  * `weapbest`. Selects the "best" weapon out of all those that the player carry which have ammo. The cvar controlling this priority is `cg_weaponOrder`; unlike the command, the cvar still needs to be set via console.
* New _dmflag_: `dmflag &4096`, allows faster underwater movement a la Q2.
* `bot_minplayers` now work for LMS and Possession.
* `capturelimit` no longer affects Team Deathmatch.
* `cg_teamChatsOnly` now only affects team-based gamemodes.
* `cg_weaponBarStyle` now returns the default weapon bar if its value falls outside its limits.
* `developer` mode has been extended with several cvars now requiring the mode to be enabled.
* `elimination_selfDamage` now takes four values: 0 (no damage to self or teammates), 1 (only damage to self), 2 (only damage to teammates a.k.a. Friendly Fire) and 3 (self and teammate damage).
* New option for `g_awardPushing`: `g_awardPushing 2`. [If a player commits suicide, the last player who attacked them scores a point.](https://openarena.ws/board/index.php?topic=5289.msg54334#msg54334)

  * `CG_IsATeamGametype(int gametype)` (cgame), `G_IsATeamGametype(int gametype)` (game), and `UI_IsATeamGametype(int gametype)` (q3_ui and ui) return true if the gametype is team-based. (For OA, it would be TDM, CTF, 1FCTF, Harvester -HAR-, Overload, Elimination, CTF Elimination -eCTF-, Double Domination -DD- and Domination -DOM-)
  * `CG_UsesTeamFlags(int gametype)` (cgame), `G_UsesTeamFlags(int gametype)` (game), and `UI_UsesTeamFlags(int gametype)` (q3_ui and ui) return true if the gametype uses the team-colored flags. (For OA, it would be CTF, 1FCTF and eCTF)

  * `BotIsThereABlueObeliskInTheMap()`, `BotIsThereARedObeliskInTheMap()` and `BotIsThereANeutralObeliskInTheMap()` return true if the match contains a red obelisk (`team_redobelisk`), a blue obelisk (`team_blueobelisk`) or a neutral obelisk (`team_neutralobelisk`).
  * `BotIsThereOurFlagInTheMap(bot_state_t *bs)` and `BotIsThereAnEnemyFlagInTheMap(bot_state_t *bs)` return true if, from the bot's own POV, there's their own team's flag or the enemy team's flag in the map.
  * `BotIsThereOurObeliskInTheMap(bot_state_t *bs)` and `BotIsThereAnEnemyObeliskInTheMap(bot_state_t *bs)` return true if, from the bot's own POV, there's their own team's obelisk or the enemy team's obelisk in the map.
  * `BotGetDominationPoint(bot_state_t *bs)` returns the actual control point the bot is taking care of. Only used for Domination.
  * `BotSetDominationPoint(bot_state_t *bs, int controlPoint)` and `BotSetOwnDominationPoint(bot_state_t *bs)` controls the control points the bot is taking care of. In the former case, it looks for a control point the bot's team doesn't own, or operate in a random point, provided the bot's team controls all the points. The latter searches among the control point the bot's team is already controlling, or assigns it a random one in case the bot's team doesn't control any point. Only used for Domination.
  * `BotMatch_AcknowledgeOrder(bot_state_t *bs, bot_match_t *match, int ltgType, float teamGoalTime)` is the general purpose order handler that replaces many functions with a similar working, some of which even called other functions, directly affecting the function stack.

They control in which situations the bots can use the Personal Teleporter, Medkit, Kamikaze and Invulnerability holdables.
  * `BotIsOnAttackingTeam(bot_state_t *bs)` is used for CTF Elimination in One-Way/Attack vs. Defense mode, and returns true if the bot is on the attacking team.
  * `BotIsFlagOnOurBase(bot_state_t *bs)` returns true if the bot's team's flag is in their team's base. Used for CTF and eCTF.
  * `BotIsEnemyFlagOnEnemyBase(bot_state_t *bs)` returns true if the bot's enemy team's flag is in the enemy team's base. Used for CTF and eCTF.
* New tools for modders for UI3:
  * `ui_randomIntToCvar(int number)` saves a random integer to a cvar.
  * `ui_randomStringToCvar(int number)` saves a random string from a list to a cvar.
  * `ui_randomFloatToCvar(int number)` saves a random floating point number to a cvar.
* New tools for mappers:
  * `state_targetname` key for `func_door`, it overrides `targetname` in round-based gametypes. [It allows the creation of doors for Elimination-based modes that open during the active time of the game](https://openarena.ws/board/index.php?topic=5437.0). In-game demonstration video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHq56Gx058w). It's already supported by [the gamepack](https://github.com/NeonKnightOA/oagamepack).

  * Support for `.info` map files (i.e. `maps/oasago2.info`). They are text files containing important data for the maps. Some configuration examples can be found [here](https://github.com/NeonKnightOA/nk-oa-assets/blob/master/maps/DM/galmevish/am_galmevish3.info) and [here](https://github.com/NeonKnightOA/nk-oa-assets/blob/master/maps/DM/blitzkrieg/blitzkrieg3.info). Supported fields:
    * `author` (Author of the map)

[It allows the creation of doors for Elimination-based modes that open during the active time of the game](https://openarena.ws/board/index.php?topic=5437.0). In-game demonstration video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHq56Gx058w).

## Elimination B01

**Initial release date:** [June 30, 2007](https://openarena.ws/board/index.php?topic=831.0)

_"I have played around with the almighty source code.<br />.<br />This mod adds a gametype "Elimination". It is round based. You have all weapons (bfg is disabled by default) and full health and must eliminate the other team. It is like elimination from SoF2, combined with the UT version of Rocket Arena (no self damage, only two teams, warmup)..<br />.<br />I believe most bugs are gone by now."_
